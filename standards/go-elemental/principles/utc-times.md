# Times in UTC

Every `time.Time` a Go Elemental library returns is in `time.UTC`, whatever `time.Local` or the
database session's `TimeZone` is. JSON encoding, cursors, logs, and `==` then give the same result
on every host.

## PostgreSQL columns store instants

A PostgreSQL column that holds a point in time is `timestamp with time zone`, which stores an
instant. [sqlate](https://github.com/standards-lab/sqlate)'s `postgres` dialect creates its
migration history's `applied_at` the same way.

## The read path converts to UTC

pgx decodes a `timestamp with time zone` into `time.Local`, and a session `TimeZone` setting does
not change that, so two layers convert on read:

- [go-database](https://github.com/standards-lab/go-database)'s `postgres` provider registers
  pgx's `TimestamptzCodec` with `ScanLocation: time.UTC` on every connection it opens.
- sqlate's `query.Scanner` and `query.Scalar` convert every `time.Time` they scan to `time.UTC`,
  whatever driver produced it.

A library that parses a time from another source converts it before returning it, as
[go-storage](https://github.com/standards-lab/go-storage)'s providers do with the HTTP dates behind
`ModifiedAt`.

## Log record times are UTC

[go-core](https://github.com/standards-lab/go-core)'s `logging.New` writes each record's own time
in `time.UTC`. A time the caller logs as an attribute keeps the Location the caller gave it.

## Tests prove UTC under a non-UTC zone

A test of a returned time runs with `time.Local` set to a zone other than UTC. A package's tests
set it to Europe/London in the package's `TestMain`, in `main_test.go`, which imports
`time/tzdata` so the zone loads without the host's zoneinfo. They use an instant in London's
summer, since London's winter offset is zero and an unconverted time prints as a UTC one does,
and they compare whole values with `==`, which compares the Location as well as the instant.

A test whose times are stamped at run time cannot choose the season, so it uses a zone whose
offset is never zero, Asia/Kolkata. go-web-service's integration tier, which runs the service
process with `TZ` set, is that case.

## Callers convert where a time leaves their code

The standard has no clock abstraction. Code that takes a time from `time.Now` or another source
and hands it out, in a response body, a cursor, or a returned value, converts it with `.UTC()` at
that point.
